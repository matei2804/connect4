#Connect Four - Python Console Game
The Connect Four game made in Python offers a text-based interface that's easy to navigate and interact with. Players take turns dropping discs into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid, aiming to connect four of their own discs in a row - horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The project employs object-oriented programming principles to ensure efficient code organization and scalability.
